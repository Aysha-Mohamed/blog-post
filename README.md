# Blog Post App

A blog app built with React and TypeScript.

## Features

- List of blog posts with titles, excerpts, and images
- Pagination for navigating through blog posts
- Search bar to filter blog posts by title
- Detailed view of each blog post
- Form to create new blog posts
- Form to edit existing blog posts

## Implementation

- Local storage used as the API for storing and retrieving blog posts
- Seed data used to populate the database initially
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implemented and persisted in local storage

## Areas of Improvement

I will be working on implementing Cypress E2E tests for this project.
